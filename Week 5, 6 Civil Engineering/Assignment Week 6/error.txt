I have run the checker on my model, which takes a quite long time (20 minutes). Then I run check.m in Matlab files
and Matlab shows these errors

formatSpec =

    'The member cannot be identifty. These nodepoints are WRONG:\r\n'


formatSpec =

    'The member cannot be identifty. These nodepoints are WRONG:\r\n'


formatSpec =

    'The member cannot be identifty. These nodepoints are WRONG:\r\n'

Error using tabular/dotParenReference (line 101)
Unrecognized table row name '1,15-19'.

Error in checkLoad (line 118)
        lineNumber = model.members.lineNumber(memberNumber);        % Line number

Error in checker (line 525)
checkLoad(LC2, model, units, reportFileID);

Honestly I don't know where this stems from, because theres little instructions on Week 6 Frame so I'm not sure of everything
in my model. A teaching assistant told me, however, that my report looks fine. 
If there's a significant error somewhere, please notify me
