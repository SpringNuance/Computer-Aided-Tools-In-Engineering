Checking the model before creating elements...
These checks take into account the fact that AutoGEM will
automatically create elements in volumes with material
properties, on surfaces with shell properties, and on curves
with beam section properties.
   Generate elements automatically.
Checking the model after creating elements...
No errors were found in the model.
