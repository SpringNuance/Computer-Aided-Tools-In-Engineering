Checker for AutoCAD Industrial Hall's cross section in ENG-A2001 Computer-aided tools in engineering course
Program inspects various features of the drawing, such as dimensions and drawing tehcniques.
Program also inspects the use of layers and monitors the number of drawing objects on certain layers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Correct template is being used 	2p

	Footings:
 -FOOTINGS layer found
 -Right number of objects and right drawing technique is used (POLYLINE). Check if there is overlapping objects. 	1p
 -Width of the foundations is correct 	1p 
 -Height of the foundations is correct 	1p 
 -Distance of the foundations in X-direction is correct 	1p  
 -Distance of the foundations in Y-direction is correct 	1p 

	Pedestals:
 -PEDSTALS layer found
 -Number of objects on the layer is incorrect
 -Distance of the pedestals in X-direction is incorrect. Check the distance and drawing technique
 -Distance of the pedestals in Y-direction is incorrect. Check the distance and drawing technique

	Columns:
 -STEEL COLUMNS layer found
 -There is correct number of objects on the layer (4-8 pieces) 	1p
 -Distance of the columns in X-direction is correct  	1p 
 -The lines depicting the columns are cut at the steel plate joint  				1p 
 -The lowest point of lines depicting columns are at correct level with respect to Y-axis 	1p 
 -The width of columns is correct 	1p 

	Center lines:
 -CENTER LINES layer found
 -Right linetype (ACAD_ISO11W100) is used in the drawing 		1p optional

	Roof structure:
 -TRUSS layer found
 -Total height of the truss is incorrect
 -Maximum width of the truss is incorrect (calculated according to the center lines)

	Steel plates of the columns:
 -STEEL PLATES layer found
 -Right number of objects and right drawing tehnique is used (POLYLINE) 	1p
 -By random inspection, the size of the steel plate is correct 	1p
 -The steel plates of the columns are at the correct distance from each other on the X-axis 	1p
 -The thickness of the steel plate joint is correct 	1p

	Dimensions:
 -DIMENSIONS layer found
 -The right chord of the truss is dimensioned correctly 	1p
 -The dimension of the lower side between the lower chord and the pedestal is correct 	1p
 -The dimension of the higher side between the lower chord and the pedestal is correct 	1p
 -Widening of the truss is dimensioned correctly 	1p
 -The pedestal is dimensioned correctly 	1p
 -The dimension between steel plate joint and column truss joint is correct 	1p 
 -There are still shortcomings in the checked dimensions. Remember that independent changing of dimensions is not permitted

	RELATIONS:
 -Footings and pedestals are at incorrect distance between each other in the Y-direction. Distance between lower surface of the footing and basepoint of the pedestal 
 -Footings and columns are at correct distance to each other in Y-direction. Lowest points of the column - upper surface of footing 	1p
 -Clearance height of the hall is correct 	1p
 -Maximum distance in the X-direction is correct 	1p
 -Height of the drawing is incorrect. Total height is calculated from lower surface of the foundation to highest point of the truss (upper chords' intersection)

	TITLES:
 -TITLES layer found.

	TEXTS:
 -TEXTS layer found.

	Layers and rasterization:
 -Rasterization is done with correct color and pattern 	1p
 -Layers are correctly created 	5p
