Checker for AutoCAD Industrial Hall's cross section in ENG-A2001 Computer-aided tools in engineering course
Program inspects various features of the drawing, such as dimensions and drawing tehcniques.
Program also inspects the use of layers and monitors the number of drawing objects on certain layers
